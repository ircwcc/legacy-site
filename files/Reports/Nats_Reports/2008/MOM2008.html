This is my report based on that experience.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">The first day, I started meeting the &#8220;guys&#8221;. They are all wonderful. Somehow the people never really figured into my idea of the hobby. The people in this hobby are a lot of fun. They are my type of people! They are all a little wacky. Their main idea is to have fun. What could possibly be wrong with that?<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">So at the beginning of the week, I watched the battles. That is when the battles finally started, see #2 above for the reason it didn&#8217;t start on time.&#160; I was having problems figuring out who was on which side. I was still having that problem at the end of the week. Several people admitted quietly that they still have that problem! However, that didn&#8217;t matter much. It was fun to see how the people handled the ships differently. Some are calm, some are loud and mouthy, some are sneaky, and some are right in your face. I will let you all assign people to the correct category. You know who you are!<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">Throughout the beginning of the week, I was quickly discovering that the fun in the hobby is the aforementioned people. Whether you are fixing the boat (see 5 above) or making breakfast or making Ice Tea, the fun was talking to the people. Everything was in the spirit of fun! There is plenty of time to just talk. The topics were widespread, the boats, life, the battles, jobs, what you need and who has it. Remember rule #2! There is a lot of smack talk, who can kick whose butt all over the lake! Whose boat it better! Which fleet is better? You get the idea. By this point, I am having the time of my life. What was coming up next was even better.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">Campaign was on Thursday. That was my favorite part. Plato let me run the Shinano for the Axis. I had a great time. I was working as hard as I could to get the hang of running, repairing and launching &#8220;my&#8221; ship.&#160; I had help from Ken and Chris. They helped me to patch and launch the ship. I was still confused by who was in which ship and how many were allowed near and when to call &#8220;Ram&#8221; or &#8220;Impeding&#8221;. It was a blast! I am proud to report that I did 7 runs. One less then the Lifeline Captain, Aidan! Way to go, Aidan! It was such a blast. Over the next couple of hours after the battle,&#160; I found myself thinking about how I could do better next time.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">Next time, what is this? Were they taking over my mind?&#160; What am I thinking, battling? Next time? Was I getting hooked??&#160; Yes, I think I might be.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">On Friday, after The Hammer sank his North Carolina, I was able to take out a combat ship during the second sortie. It wasn&#8217;t official. I was trying to stay out of the way. I tried to figure out how to run the ship and shoot the guns. I am having problems with shooting the wrong guns! Everyone says I will get better. I would hope so. So, I didn&#8217;t do very well but I think that is because it was an Allied Ship! BONZAI!!<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">Then it was clean up time and the banquet, which is just another great dinner with everyone. They gave out a lot of fun awards. Then it was the annual meeting and rules meetings. These were very enlightening! Then off to bed at the early hour of 1:30 AM!<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">So, what did I think of the week? It was great! A lot of fun and very relaxing but now I know why they come back tired. Not enough sleep! <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">So do I still think it is a stupid hobby? Yes. And it will still be stupid when MY Viribus Unitis hits the water! Yes, I am building a ship and yes, I am going Axis. Remember I warned you; watch out if you are on my right, when I try to use my left gun!<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">See you guys at the lake!<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0"><b>Combat Mom</b><br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size12 Helvetica12" color="#273AC0">AKA Ginger Andrews<br></font></div></div><!-- </hs:element7> --><!-- <hs:element8> --><div style="position: absolute; top: 1798px; left: 223px; width: 138px; height: 41px; z-index: 4;" id="element8"><div align="left"><SCRIPT SRC="../../../../_navs/2008back.js" TYPE="text/javascript"></SCRIPT><noscript><font style="font-weight:bold;" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10"><a target="_self" href="../2008-NATS-report.html">Back 2008</a></font></noscript></div></div><!-- </hs:element8> --></div></div>
