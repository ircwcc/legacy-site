The food was fantastic, beer was cold, and the comradery and good-natured pre-Nats ribbing was intense. It was clear to all the axis captains that the allied captains had a few too many drinks when they insisted on battling traditional allied-axis the first day despite the significant axis advantage. I knew, as all true axis knew, that even if the allied had superior numbers the axis would still dominate.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Monday was a perfect New England day with clear blue skies and just a slight breeze. The lake was perfectly calm except for the wake from several geese patrolling the area. The captains arrived with the typical pre-Nats mix of emotions - a sense of excitement for the coming battle, and fear that their ship would malfunction and they'd be turned into mince meat. Don Fisher had done a good job advertising the event and many spectators, the press, and several TV news crews were on site to observe the battle.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">The axis were very confident with a 51 unit to 28 unit advantage. The allied captains were maintaining their steady stream of bravado before the battle but it sounded pretty forced. Axis Admiral Will Montgomery's plan was to attack hard but save the 24-second Derfflinger's for the end of the sortie for cleanup. The ships were put on the water but Dave Tuttle's Krownprinz had mechanical problems and didn't make it in giving the allies their first break. The battle began and allied Admiral Decker's Kentucky immediately drew a crowd. After the battle every axis captain claimed to have put a few rounds into the behemoth target. Don Fisher's Valiant became the first Nats sink in the first sortie after he tangled with Will Montgomery's triple bow guns and a hoard of pig boats. <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">The second sortie was more of the same carnage as Bill Garthaffner's Houston, Dave Vogtman's North Carolina, and the Kentucky sank in rapid succession. After the North Carolina sank, we noticed Dave fiddling with his transmitter instead of retrieving his ship. He said &quot;hang on a minute&quot; and shortly after that a pink rubber punch balloon burst to the surface. The balloon pulled Dave's ship off the bottom to the surface where he calmly recovered it. The Vogtman Recovery System (VRS) worked to perfection and was a Nats week highlight. David Ricci spent both sorties juking and jigging with his North Carolina avoiding side mounts while maneuvering to get his triple sterns on targets. He still took heavy damage and was seconds from sinking when his five minutes expired and he touched his ship. Cam Moury gave the allied team a lift when his pump clogged and he went down with moderate damage. The outcome was as expected with all but one allied ship sinking and the axis racking up 15,900 points to the allied 5,480 points.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Top points for the morning:<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Allied<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Decker Kentucky 235-13-23 Sunk<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Garthaffner Houston 78-9-39 Sunk<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Vogtman N.

During the lunch break Admiral Decker conceded defeat to Admiral Montgomery and the fleets were split up. The flag fleet ships were given rainbow colored tie-wraps to affix to their masts and they were quickly named the Rainbow Warriors. Someone came up with the name Maulers for the other team and since no one had a better name it stuck. <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">The afternoon battling continued to be hot and heavy with the Maulers (my team) clearly dominating the wimpier Rainbow Warriors. The Rainbow fleet lost Marty Hayes' Viribus Unitis (VU), Ed Sheperd's Lutzow, the Kentucky and Carl Camarati's Yamato to Davy Jones' locker during the afternoon battle. The Maulers didn't lose a ship. One interesting sink was when Don Fisher, driving his Espana (changed from the Valiant after the morning carnage), bumped his transmitter and put his ship in reverse while he was helping recover Ed Sheperd's Lutzow. The Espana drove itself under and sank. Don emptied the water out of his ship and kept battling. Final score for the afternoon battle was a lopsided Maulers 14,495 to the Rainbow Warrior's 5,400.

However, when we got back to the hotel, Tom Tanner presented Steve with a beautiful daily Axis High Spirit Award made by Peter Lienau, our German IRCWCC member. Peter made one for each of the daily winners that raised the stakes for winning the award significantly for the rest of the week.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size14 Helvetica14" color="#000000"><u><b>Tuesday</b></u><br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Monday was a day of shame for the Allies. After defeat in Monday's first battle the fleets were divided. Now it was the Maulers vs. the Rainbow warriors. And after a pitiful Monday loss in round one of the new fleets, the Rainbow Warriors vowed to strike back.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Tuesday's morning battle went the same as Monday's afternoon battle. With no clear strategy except &quot;sink the other team&quot; the battle quickly developed into a furball of death. Tremendous damage was being done to all sides as ships switched from one target to another. Confusion and close quarters were the rule of the day. Frank Pittelli learned that sometimes a poorly secured superstructure was a bad thing after being washed under by the wake of the USS North Carolina of David Ricci. And Don Fisher noted that the dock is not your friend as the Espana hit the launching dock and sank. Thus early on the Rainbow fleet had lost two ships.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Then everyone noticed something. Something big. Something in the middle of the furball. Chris Decker's Kentucky. Already hurting, it soon became the major target of most of the Maulers on the pond. Driven towards the shore, the mighty battlewagon took a tremendous pounding before going down. However, the sortie ended soon after as the Kentucky ate up most of the mauler's remaining ammunition. Decker didn't even bother cutting the silkspan into small pieces to patch- he used whole sheets.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">In the second sortie, the battle developed into a furball again. But this time the punishment was spread around more evenly between the ships, resulting in only a single sink Tom Tanner in the Hindenburg sent the Houston to the bottom despite the best efforts of the crippled Von Der Tann of Matt Moury to defend the cruiser. But it was a pathetic gesture against the heavy casualties the Rainbow Warriors had suffered in this battle. The Maulers won by 4330 points. The Rainbow Warriors then pinned all their hopes on campaign.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">And they had a significant advantage. Two convoy ships vs. only one in the possession of the Maulers. Thus the maulers had to sink twice as many convoy ships as the rainbow warriors to come ahead. Unlike fleet battle, both sides actually used strategy here. The Maulers plans were to sink the enemy convoy ships as quickly as possible, while denying the rainbow warriors the luxury of reloading. A powerful force would stay behind to ensure the safety of the Mauler targets, while a crack sharpshooter squad equipped with high-firing weapons took out the Rainbow targets. With the new campaign rules this was a sound strategy, as the ability of ships to reload was now related to whether or not the targets were still standing.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">The Rainbow Warrior strategy centered on efficient hunting of convoys. With the aid of a new rule allowing only one attacker to attack a convoy but prohibiting defending ships from intervening, they felt that it would be easy enough to sink the Mauler convoy. A whole string of class fours was assigned this duty, stretched across the pond. They sent only token forces to guard their own targets and to shoot the mauler targets.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">The battle began with a scramble to get convoys in the water, as well as some early squaring off of the warships. The Mauler target squad took aim at the targets immediately with deadly effect, while the mauler defense force of David's North Carolina and Nathan Blateau's Musashi wrought havoc with the rainbow target squad. But in the important (and decisive) area of convoy runs the Rainbow Warriors were king. Right off the bat they completed two convoy runs, while the mauler convoy encountered technical difficulties and sank.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">The Mauler convoy ship however had one other notable effect. The poor quality transmitter bled onto a neighboring frequency causing the North Carolina of David Ricci to loose control. After control was partially restored the ship then went on a rampage and during it's five out of control period sent the Okinashima of Tom Tanner and the Andrea Doria of Carl Camerauti to the slimy deep.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">Elsewhere the Maulers continued to prove their combat superiority, as the North Carolina of Dave Voughtman and the Phoenix of Dave Lewis were both sunk. But all these warship sinkings and the massacre of the rainbow targets could not outstrip the many convoy runs of the rainbow fleet, as despite heroic efforts the maulers failed to launch another convoy ship. To add insult to injury, the rainbow margin of victory was made even greater as Nathan's Musashi plowed Frank Pitelli under in a vicious ram sink. The rainbow fleet won by 6,225, thus completely erasing the morning's gains for the Maulers and even making up for some of the previous day's whacking.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"> <br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000">All in all Tuesday was great battling and everyone had fun. That was a victory for everyone.<br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size10 Helvetica10" color="#000000"><br></font></div></div><!-- </hs:element7> --><!-- <hs:element8> --><div style="position: absolute; top: 2512px; left: 322px; width: 138px; height: 41px; z-index: 3;" id="element8"><div align="left"><SCRIPT SRC="../../../../_navs/2001reports.js" TYPE="text/javascript"></SCRIPT><noscript><font style="font-weight:bold;" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" class="size11 Helvetica11"><a target="_self" href="../../../../Battle-Reports.html">Battle Reports</a></font></noscript></div></div><!-- </hs:element8> --></div></div>
