<TD><B><P>Holmes, NY June 28 ---  </B>Reports out of New York indicate that the Allied Fleet, led by Admiral Steve Andrews, was decisively defeated as they tried to secure a foothold in the pond at Camp Conron, home port of the largest vessel in Japanese contingent of the Axis Fleet, IJN Musashi captained by Daisa Carl Camurati-san.  Intelligence gathered by the Tri-Pact Security Agency BattleStar Management System (BSMS) indicates the Allies learned early in 2013 that Daisa (Japanese for Captain) Camurati-san had decided beer was more to his liking than sake and had transferred his commission to the German High Seas Fleet where he was welcomed with open arms.  Now Kapitän Camurati began construction of a new 4 unit SMS NASSAU-class dreadnought. (A unit is either a cannon with 50 BBs or a pump with a 1/8” outlet.  Most vessels mount a single pump and use the rest of the units as guns.) Completed just in time to meet the Allied advance into his home waters, the NASSAU would see the highs and lows of the battle that would develop.</P>

<P>In the traditional way of this form of conflict, the captains of both fleets met on Sunday June 23 to take the measure of each other’s ships. The Sunday rendezvous at Camp Conron confirmed one BSMS report – the Allies were coming light.  Seven ships sailed into the contested waters of Camp Conron, matching the seven ships the Axis Fleet, beset by budget woes, had been able to muster.  Led by Admiral Steve Andrews in the rookie USS ARKANSAS (a Class 5 dreadnought with 4 guns carrying 50 BBs each and a full size bilge pump, aka 5 units), the rest of the Allied Fleet consisted of the ARKANSAS’ equally new sister ship USS WYOMING captained by Matt Andrews, the venerable USS NORTH CAROLINA (6 units) captained by Captain Marty “The Legend” Hayes, last year’s flagship HMS MARLBOROUGH (5 units) under the command of now-Captain Tim Krakowski, the huge 8 unit USS MISSOURI (Captain Jim Beahm), the resurrected USS ARIZONA (5.5 units) of Captain Rob Arena and last but not least the new 3.5 unit cruiser USS DES MOINES (Captain Ginger “Combat Mom” Andrews).  In all the Allied vessels brought 30 guns carrying more than 1500 BBs to each battle.</P>

<P>Facing this onslaught would be the mostly veteran Axis Fleet led by Gross Admiral Tom Tanner in SMS OSTFRIESLAND (4.5 units) supported by other vessels of the 1st and 3rd Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet - sister-ship SMS THURINGEN (Kapitän Ken Kelly) and Kapitän Aidan Kelly in SMS KONIG (5 units), as well as the veteran SMS SCHARNHORST (3.5 units) captained by rookie Korvettenkapitän Josephine “Joe” Dennis.  The Kriegsmarine was represented by the feared (and rightfully so, even when reduced from 7 units) 6.5 unit DKM BISMARCK under the expert command of Kapitän Chris Kessler while the Nihon Kagun sent Daisa Ron Hunt and the 6 unit IJN NAGATO.  Add in Kapt. Camurati’s 4 unit NASSAU and the Axis had 27 guns and 1350 BBs to send into each battle with the Allied Fleet.  Given the highly effective shooting performance and reliability of the Axis Fleet in the past and its demonstrated ability to defeat Allied Fleets that outnumbered it almost 2 to 1, victory seemed assured. However Gr. Adm. Tanner was familiar with the friction and fog of war where anything can happen (and usually does!) and admonished his captains to be smart and aggressive driving their attacks home.  </P>

<P>On a lighter note Kapt. Camurati, to show his allegiance to the German Fleet, decorated the Conron galley with a hanging sausage.  Captains were also reminded why it was good to sink close to shore at Conron when a monster snapping turtle took up residence on the edge of the battling area.  There were several suggestions to feed him Carl’s sausage to make sure he was full and not looking for the body parts of captains recovering their ships.</P>

<P>As the teams closed out the day they took a moment to remember comrades who had fallen over the past year including Dan McGuffin from the Ontario Attack Squadron, Rookie Allied Training Squadron (RATS) founder Larry Ricci and, in the loss felt the most of all, the early and untimely passing of frequent Allied Admiral and good friend to all battlers – Don Fisher. RIP.</P>


<P><H3><B>Day One – Early Axis Loss Precedes Allied Rout on Monday</B></H3></P>


<P>The morning was warm, the sky blue and sun bright as the two fleets steamed toward each other that Monday morning intent on blasting and destroying opponent ships and forcing enemy captains to wear “wet shorts” of shame.  With the traditional call of “It’s War!”, 14 ships, seven from each fleet, closed to point-blank range and  BB guns started their distinctive “thwap-thwap” as BBs left gun barrels to penetrate the thin 1/32” armor of enemy warships.  Kapt. Ken Kelly took his rookie consort K.Kpt. Dennis under his wing to show her the proper methods for driving her new command, SMS SCHARNHORST, effectively taking SMS THURINGEN (0-0-0, shorthand for saying the ship had no hits above, on or below the waterline. Hits on the waterline count as 10 points, on are 25 points and below the waterline hits count for 50 points) out of most of the battle and for all intents and purposes making the sides 7 to 5 in favor of the Allies.  But Marty Hayes’ NORTH CAROLINA, already suffering from a failed automatic pump switch detected before the battle began but hard wired to run continuously, was having difficulty with its triple stern guns and his ship stayed out of the fray, also receiving no damage (0-0-0) during the battle.  The low numbers posted by these two ships as well as the cruisers DES MOINES (5-0-0) and SCHARNHORST (5-2-0) make the carnage exchanged by the remaining 10 ships all the more impressive.  In the first sortie of the battle NASSAU closed with all comers taking serious damage, providing the new Kessler-Camurati automatic brushless bilge pump Mk IX with a hard test of its capabilities.  Unfortunately the Mk IX failed the test when it’s crew decided it couldn’t handle the load and the new NASSAU slipped beneath the waves with a hit total of 41-14-38, equal to 3460 points and the only sink of the first sortie.</P>

<P>Meanwhile the Axis flagship, SMS OSTFRIESLAND, in a reprise of last year’s Admiral’s Battle, saddled up next to the HMS MARLBOROUGH and for several seconds the BBs flew and water thrashed as they slugged it out.  The OSTFRIESLAND, heavily damaged with below the waterline hits trying to get its bow sidemount into action against the MALRBOROUGH’s bow, pulled out of the line to hunt easier prey and exchanged rounds with both the ARKANSAS and WYOMING.  Those ships were also engaged by KONIG and NAGATO, NAGATO using a surprisingly hard firing offset bow gun to inflict damage at range while joining the German ships as they closed in tight to slug it out with their dreadnought-era opponents. BISMARCK (24-2-14) and NAGATO (32-6-19) trained in on MISSOURI and once they had the scent they drew blood, pounding the huge vessel in both sorties. MISSOURI, attempting to evade its tormenters, occasionally fell in with the deadly accurate KONIG (9-3-3), the wounded OSTFRIESLAND (12-2-22) and Kapt. Kelly’s THURINGEN, now free to bring its fully armed vessel into the battle after escorting SCHARNHORST out of the battle zone. The damage to the Allied fleet began to tell. ARIZONA took 83 hits above and 40 hits on or below the waterline and went “On 5” pumping furiously. (To exit the battle you can’t just say “I’m done” and pull your boat.  You call “On 5” and then wait five minutes during which the enemy can pursue and shoot your ship but you cannot fire back.) During the second sortie MARLBOROUGH’s damage (60-10-19) forced her damage control crews to abandon their pumping duties, the pump failed and MARLBOROUGH slipped beneath the waves, soon followed by ARKANSAS (59-10-19), WYOMING (50-8-10) and finally MISSOURI (145-6-69).  Three Allied Class 5’s and a Class 7 sunk versus the loss of one Axis Class 4 plus the high number of below the waterline hits inflicted on the Allies resulted in a big Axis victory in Battle #1: Axis captains scored 14,540 points of damage against the Allies who scored 7,555 points.</P>

<P>Ships were recovered, damage assessed and mostly repaired, and captains lunched to prepare for Battle #2.  Unfortunately it was discovered during the break that Marty’s veteran USS NORTH CAROLINA, a ship he had reliably just pulled from the shelf to use in battle after battle with little major maintenance, had finally given up the ghost and suffered full systems failure. Pump, drive motors and 3 of 5 guns had failed in Battle #1 or just after and she could not sail out for Battle #2.  It looked like Marty “The Legend” Hayes’ NATS was over.  </P>

<P>Battle #2 in the hot/humid afternoon went mostly like the first battle.  The NC was out of service; the MISSOURI (24-2-10) was having radio problems and stayed on the edges of the fray chased by the Axis ships BISMARCK (6-2-2) and NASSAU while NAGATO (30-9-13) with the smaller Axis dreadnoughts closed to engage in close with the Allied small ships.  Capt. Steve “The Hammer” Andrews sailed ARKANSAS directly into the middle of the 1st and 3rd Battle Squadrons right at the start of the battle, hoping to draw them onto the anvil of the WYOMING, MARLBOROUGH and ARIZONA.  Unfortunately those ships failed to engage leaving the ARKANSAS to fight alone against 4 Axis ships.  Flagship OSTFRIESLAND led the assault along with NASSAU (26-3-14), KONIG (23-3-10), THURINGEN (10-5-6) and NAGATO leaving the ARKANSAS pumping furiously as the 1st sortie ended.  Shortly into the second sortie ARKANSAS (34-9-39) went down along with the MARLBOROUGH (67-13-17) whose pump failed again.  OSTFRIESLAND had re-engaged MARLBOROUGH using a new gunnery pattern, dropping the bow sidemount for dual stern guns and stern sidemount that proved extremely effective, for the rest of the week OSTFRIESLAND (16-5-9) only once more took more damage than she did that first battle.</P>
 
<P>After the loss of MARLBORO and ARKANSAS and the early withdrawal of MISSOURI the remaining Allied ships ARIZONA, WYOMING and DES MOINES found themselves facing a six strong Axis pursuit force (SCHARNHORST sat out this battle leaving THURINGEN available right from the start of battle).  ARIZONA (83-16-23) was the first to suffer but survived by calling an early “On 5”.  Damage to DES MOINES (19-6-5) shows she fell under Axis guns as she tried to provide what support she could with her stern guns.  But the brunt of the Axis attack developed around the WYOMING.  In an impressive display of the new ship’s maneuverability and Capt. Matt Andrew’s ability to cause the Axis ships to block each other for shots, though pursued by no less than 4 Axis ships including the dreaded BISMARCK, the WYOMING took heavy damage above the waterline but maintained enough distance to avoid their sidemounts and survived the battle with 123 hits above the waterline but only 15 on or below (123-4-11).  With the damage and sinks the Allies lost Battle #2: Allies 4,485 to Axis 11,400.  As of the end of the day the Axis held a nearly 14,000 point lead, 25,940 to 12,040.</P>

<P>But the Axis cannot be said to have been unsympathetic to the woes of the Allied Fleet.  Kapt. Camurati, who had flirted with the Allied cause just a few years ago, traveled home Monday night and returned with a gift for Capt. Hayes - his fully operational USS NORTH CAROLINA.  The Allies would be back at full strength for Tuesday’s battles.</P>


<P><H3><B>Day Two – An Opportunity Lost – Twice on Tuesday</B></H3></P>


<P>As the first sortie of the 3rd battle started it quickly became apparent that the Allies had a plan.  The ARKANSAS, ARIZONA, WYOMING and MARLBOROUGH had formed up line abreast parallel to shore in the center of the battling area with their sterns presented to the Axis fleet small ships while the fast Allied ships MISSOURI, NORTH CAROLINA and DES MOINES pulled the BISMARCK and NAGATO away.  Leading from the front (but doing so in reverse to use her new stern heavy gun configuration) OSTFRIESLAND joined by KONIG backed toward the MARLBOROUGH.  Allied communications traffic increased and the BSMS quickly intercepted a signal from the Allied flagship ARKANSAS that their target was identified as the lead ship approaching.  The Allied plan was now apparent – envelop the Axis flagship and decapitate their fleet’s leadership!  Confident in the Krupp armor and guns of his flagship, G.Adm. Tanner accepted the challenge and backed down the port side of MARLBOROUGH (44-12-18), starting a sharp and furious exchange of shots between the vessels.  Water splashed and holes opened in each ship’s hulls, pumps lighting off to get the water back out.  Before the Allied reinforcements could close and surround it, the OSTFRIESLAND (15-3-21) moved back toward his fleet but stayed close enough to the four Allied ships to remain a threat to each.  In a four to one Mexican standoff the five ships maneuvered their sterns hoping to force their enemy to make a mistake and open themselves up to a killing exchange.  But this also had an unintended effect – it kept four Allied ships pinned when they were needed most – the BISMARCK was dead in the water and drifting to shore!</P>

<P>BISMARCK had started the sortie in pursuit of MISSOURI (50-6-21) but during the maneuvering battle that developed the BISMARCK suffered a loss of both main propulsion and pumping capability leaving her at the whims of wind and current as she came to shore behind the Allied lines.  While the MISSOURI, NC and DES MOINES attempted to put down the “the Beast” the NAGATO (19-2-16) and NASSAU (56-8-23) valiantly defended their shipmate until they could be reinforced. SCHARNHORST (7-2-3) closed and drew off DES MOINES (25-1-10), the cruiser battle between female opponents taking some Allied captains attention off BISMARCK.  THURINGEN (7-1-0) and KONIG (30-13-15) arrived to fend off the Allied small ships that had finally seen what was happening but for the Allies it was too late, the BISMARCK survived its five minutes and the sortie wound down.  Boats were pulled and reloaded, BISMARCK repaired (faulty ESC was suspected) and the battle rejoined as the second sortie got underway.  WYOMING (58-7-17) could not repeat its feat from Monday afternoon and slipped beneath the waves while the rejuvenated BISMARCK (57-10-34) hunted its former oppressors, MISSOURI (50-6-21) and NORTH CAROLINA (36-9-18).  But while the plan had failed for the Allies, they did lose the battle by a much smaller margin than the two battles on the day before, 12,000 to 8,485.  In the Allied Fleet hope began to rise that the tide was turning in their favor.</P>

<P>Battle #4 saw that tide rise and swamp the Allies.  Early in the 1st sortie the barely damaged WYOMING suffered a catastrophic pump failure and sank with only 13 holes (10-0-3), followed by Adm. Andrews coming under fire personally and receiving several hits from ricochets.  These events prevented the Allied Fleet from keeping the same discipline among the small ships that they had shown in Battle #3 but they still maneuvered and fought individual engagements as they got close to enemy ships.  The rest of the first sortie ended and the second started where the first had left off.  </P>

<P>Capt. Krakowski in MARLBOROUGH (65-12-25) had repaired the ship’s pump and locked its crew in their compartments to encourage their remaining at their stations, this seemed to work and MARLBORO survived as did ARKANSAS (51-11-21).  Daisa Hunt in NAGATO (66-9-27) sought out heavy action as usual and survived.  The DES MOINES however had one of her two propeller shafts get fouled followed by a pump failure and it drifted to the same spot BISMARCK had in Battle #3 but without “the Beast’s” volume DEZI (10-1-8) went sinker at the shoreline.  Ships on both sides were pumping and calling “On 5” but several ships were still on the water and in the battle. OSTFRIESLAND (36-3-19) had engaged numerous Allied ships in quick encounters and, out of ammunition, called “On 5” when it noticed BISMARCK out in deep water motionless. G.Adm. Tanner initiated secure communications with Kapt. Kessler and learned BISMARCK was again out of control though this time the pump was working.  Almost simultaneous with this the lookouts reported that the NORTH CAROLINA was approaching.  Capt. Hayes, confident in his well-founded and fully operational vessel, had been particularly aggressive all day, even closing to engage in sidemount battles instead of sneaking in to pellet opponents with triple sterns as he normally did. And now he was closing on the hapless BISMARCK. Although out of ammunition OSTRFRIESLAND could still maneuver and rapidly cut the NC off, leading it away from BISMARCK until the NC would again attempt to attack the BISMARCK when OSTFRIESLAND would intercede again. In this manner both Axis ships finished out their five minutes after which OSTFRIESLAND pushed its much larger shipmate back to homeport for recovery.  Once in drydock it was determined BISMARCK had stripped the main bull gear on its propeller shaft taking the turbines off-line. </P>

<P>As ships came to shore and after the CO2 bottles were pulled from ships to render them safe the damage was assessed.  Again the Allies had missed an opportunity to sink or at least severely damage the BISMARCK, but as before they had lost by a smaller margin than the battle before.  The totals:  Axis scored 10,045 points of damage on the Allies while receiving 7,415 points in damage.  The Axis Fleet was still ahead but no longer had a 2-1 lead, the end of day score was Allies 27,940 to the Axis 47,985.</P>

<P>On land the Risk Campaign began with five players, Axis G.Adm. Tanner with Kapitäns Camurati and A. Kelly and on the Allied side Adm. S. Andrews and Capt. M. Andrews.  As the first night ended the Axis forces of Kapt. Camurati held a dominant position on the battlefield, mostly because of an unholy alliance with Allied Adm. Andrews to hold Asia and Europe.  Kapt. Kelly’s position in North America was the weakest from direct attacks from Adm. Andrews while G.Adm. Tanner hunkered down in Africa to await the onslaught from Kapt. Camurati to the East and Capt. M. Andrews to the West in South America.  </P>


<P><H3><B>Day Three – Wednesday Challenges and Night Battle</B></H3></P>


<P>Wednesday at NATS is less structured than the days preceding or after.  The day is free for captains to travel to visit local sites, sleep in, make major repairs or challenge other captains to individual or small group battles.  Leading up to NATS Allied Admiral Steve Andrews had already filled out an extensive dance card online, the first event being a challenge to his family (and the Kelly’s) to what at one time had been called the “Father-Son” battle but was now called the “Family Battle.”  Steve and his father-in-law Marty Hayes would join forces with Ken Kelly to battle Ken’s son Aidan, Steve’s son Matt and Marty’s daughter (and to make it more confusing, Steve’s wife) Ginger.  Although it is supposed to be a “small fleet” action the battle, as the Family Battle often does, became a series of one-on-one battles between parents and children.  The nearly identical ARKANSAS and WYOMING slugged it out while the THURINGEN and KONIG maneuvered against each other, the NORTH CAROLINA trying to chase down the small but speedy DES MOINES.  Occasionally these individual melees intersected and like dancers at a ball they cut in on one another.  This caused a bit of confusion for both teams, as each had similar ships on each side.  Aidan’s KONIG and Matt’s WYOMING looked very much if not identical to their parents THURINGEN and ARKANSAS, leading to some parents shooting other parents and children shooting children.  But as the first sortie of the battle ended the battle appeared pretty even with both the ARKANSAS and the WYOMING taking a lot of damage.  But more importantly the WYOMING was having problems with its pump.  </P>

<P>After replacing his pump motor after it failed Tuesday, Matt had also decided to re-arrange the location of his pump.  An unintended consequence of this move was the hose was longer and, unnoticed in the rush to complete the job, has a significant rise midway between the pump and the outlet.  The result, a “vapor lock” that prevented the pump from pumping until the water level in the hull reach a certain point, put the WYOMING in danger of sinking several times in the first sortie.  Still un-diagnosed when the second sortie began, Matt’s level of frustration grew minute by minute as the pump would fail to pump water until the ship seemed about to sink when the pump would suddenly kick in and pump the ship out.  But being close to sinking meant the WYOMING couldn’t maneuver often or well to prevent the ship’s movement from pushing water in faster.  Instead the WYOMING was an easy target, taking additional hits until the pump would kick in and he could move around and fire back.  But eventually the new holes and the pump issues were too much and WYOMING sank beneath the waves.  In the end ARKANSAS took 30+ below the waterline hits but WYOMING’s sink was just enough to put the parents over the top and win by 60 points.</P>

<P>Allied Admiral Steve Andrews had issued another challenge before NATS, an Admiral’s Battle against the Axis Gross Admiral Tom Tanner.  After Steve repaired the damage from the Family Battle the ARKANSAS and OSTFRIESLAND took to the water for a one-on-one contest.  But instead of being a two sortie battle this one was to the death – both ships would reload and fight until one went under.  The two ships, closely matched in size and firepower (ARKANSAS carries 4 guns and a pump while OSTFRIESLAND has 3.5 guns and a pump; AK is also just over 2 inches longer than OST) the battle was expected to be close.  The OSTFRIESLAND quickly showed it could turn in a tighter circle than the ARKANSAS but the AK could accelerate faster.  During the first sortie the two ships maneuvered for advantage, the AK attempting to get the OST 10-12 inches off the port or starboard quarter to use its stern sidemounts, the OST trying to get in closer to use its lower to the water stern sidemount and close shooting dual stern guns.  By the end of the sortie it was apparent the OSTFRIESLAND was getting the better shots, ARKANSAS was pumping heavily and when removed from the water it had several large clusters of hits near or on the waterline.  Gassed and reloaded, the two ships went out for the next sortie of this battle to the death, the ships closing to slug it out with sidemounts.  Superior Axis gunnery began to take its toll and after only a few minutes of battle ARKANSAS slipped beneath the waves with over 3000 points in damage.  ARKANSAS had so much damage that Steve could not fight the last battle on his dance card against Ron Hunt in the NAGATO, he had to prepare for the craziness we call Night Battle.</P>

<P>Night Battle is what it sounds like.  The boats are readied and, should the captain chose, modified with the addition of lights.  Some are set on switches the captain can control, some turn on when the pump turns on or turns off, some captains depend on their night vision and don’t put lights on their ships at all.  After the sun goes down all flashlights, pits and building lights and, if we can control them, street and parking lights, are turned off and the boats put on the water.  In this case six Axis ships - OSTFRIESLAND, THURINGEN, KONIG, NASSAU, BISMARCK and NAGATO sailed out to fight five Allied ships – ARKANSAS, WYOMING, ARIZONA, MARLBOROUGH and NORTH CAROLINA.  Since it was so dark it is difficult to report who did what to whom but the results showed that the fighting was vicious.  Kapt. Camurati reports he was watching the silhouette of his NASSAU when he heard a loud “thunk” and soon thereafter his boat disappeared.  Another ship, never identified, had mistakenly rammed NASSAU (10-2-9) in the dark and sunk it. Meanwhile eyewitnesses on OSTFRIESLAND (10-2-10) report that as the call of “It’s War” was made she found herself next to the unsuspecting ARKANSAS (74-9-24) and quickly emptied most of her stern sidemount into it, turned out and fired several salvos from the dual stern guns. Sailing out and to the right side of the pond she then identified the ARIZONA off alone when it was lit up by the NAGATO’s bright blue lights, snuck up and emptied the rest of her stern guns into her, though with the dark and the distance it’s doubtful many struck home.  However for whatever reasons the ARIZONA (25-6-3) also sank beneath the waves joined by the WYOMING (18-3-7) which was still plagued with pump problems. NAGATO (14-4-18), with its bright lights drawing lots of Allied attention, soon was the center of a melee that saw the MARLBOROUGH take 8-2-6 in damage while the NORTH CAROLINA (0-3-1), KONIG (1-1-2) and THURINGEN (5-1-0) cut in to deliver stealthy attacks and retreat before they could take serious hits themselves.  And the tight turning BISMARCK (8-0-6) could be seen with its lights spinning around like an airport beacon light, distracting the Allies then striking fear into their hearts when the lights went out – where would “the Beast” strike from?  In all it was a night of long knives, surprisingly deadly with the loss of three ships sunk, two Allied and one Axis.  Adding in the damage points the Axis again proved “Axis Rule the Night” winning 5,675 to 3,780.</P>

<P>One of the fun things about Night Battle is that when ships sink the captain doesn’t always know where she went down!  Fortunately this night one ship was able to make it to shore before going under but the other two ships were farther out.  Since Conron is somewhat deep IRCWCC had instituted a rule several years ago requiring all ships to be equipped with floats to mark sunken ships locations.  As luck would have it the two ships were only 6-8 feet from shore in 3 feet of water and materialized eerily when powerful flashlights were shined on them, appearing ghostlike in the rippling water.  Salvage experts recovered the vessels and investigators surveying the NASSAU reported that the ram hole in her port side was well below the waterline with a shape suspiciously similar to the shape of the stern of several German dreadnoughts.  Could the NASSAU have been the victim of a strike from a friendly ship?  In the dark and the confusion of battle we’ll never know.</P>


<P><H3><B>Day Four – Cam-Pain Strikes Again!</B></H3></P>


<P>The Allies had been on the cusp of a come-back, losing each battle but by smaller margins, and as Thursday dawned the score was 31,720 to 53,660 in the Axis favor. But as related earlier, if the Axis could take large leads in the early battles they could lose them just as quickly.  So Axis High Command reminded all captains to remain aggressive in pressing their attacks.  In the Allied camp wafted the smell of defeat. Meanwhile both sides received reinforcements.  </P>

<P>For the Allies, Captain Nate Graham arrived Tuesday night with the not yet completed pre-dreadnought USS CHARLOTTE, 3 units and two convoy ships, a Landing Ship, Tank (LST) and the small French coastal steamer GOLO. But even after frantic work to get the CHARLOTTE together late into the night on Wednesday it was still unfinished as Battle #5 started, robbing the Allies of much needed support.  Kapt. Tim Filmyer arrived Wednesday morning with two vessels, the pocket battleship DKM LUTZOW of 3.5 units and the not yet completed Austrian-Hungarian battleship SMS PRINZ EUGEN, 4 units.  LUTZOW was quickly tested and for the 5th Battle on Thursday morning assigned duties to help pursue the speedy NORTH CAROLINA and MISSOURI while the K.Kpt. Dennis of SCHARNHORST decided to sit out to perform photo reconnaissance duties freeing her consort THURINGEN for tasking right from the start of the battle.  </P>

<P>Early in the battle the Axis flagship took a hit at the bridge level that killed the log keeper and destroyed the log for that battle.  Below is an excerpt from the battle log of IJN NAGATO, Daisa Ron Hunt commanding:</P>

<P>“Near the end of the first sortie in fleet battle the NAGATO lost acceleration and turning temporarily.  On the table the starboard prop only turned half the time when commanded to.  I figured I had blown a couple of teeth on the plastic idler gear. I went ahead and put it in the water anyway, and the starboard prop promptly quit answering the helm altogether.  Battle was declared, so I called 5 out of control, tried to keep it close to shore with partial steering and propulsion and yawned as the Allies pulled up one by one to take their beatings in turn.  Marty pulled up in his shiny new NC and took about 15 rounds out of A turret before he fled the scene, firing a couple of stern gun volleys as he went.  Next in the queue was Steve Andrews in the ARKANSAS, who managed to find what he thought was a blind spot behind the A turret, he instead ate about 20 rounds from the D turret rotate, but probably took a few more holes overall in the engagement than he anticipated, and drove off to sink later in the sortie with a respectable 118-15-53.  At nearly the same time Matt Andrews WYOMING poked around the other side and took a few from C turret, but the courageous Axis Gross Admiral engaged him and he peeled off and sank a couple of minutes later with 125-15-17.  I fired a few dozen rounds from the B turret dual bows at Jim Beahm's MISSOURI as he ran interference and blocking duty for the Allies, and in turn the NAGATO absorbed its share of his triples and a few sidemounts.  Rob Arena overtook the NAGATO in his ARIZONA as I made a wide starboard turn and (ARIZONA) lost about 2 or 3 square inches of balsa in the bow when NAGATO nearly emptied the remainder of C and D magazines at point blank range.  Rob decided the ARIZONA (76-6-32) would do better elsewhere on the pond, and went to go sit still at the edge of battle.  During this I assume Tim Krakowski's MARLBOROUGH was pinning down the remainder of the Axis, but paid the price by sinking with 92-11-24.  With my 5 minutes nearly up I turned the NAGATO towards shore, pumping a decent amount but easily handling the damage with the reduced speed helping reduce the inflow.  The wide turn radius did it in though when it got too close to shore and wrapped some long grass up in the prop, which winched the back end underwater just after the 5 minute timer expired, but before I touched it.  Final tally on the NAGATO was 125-24-50.”</P>

<P>With the loss of three Class 5 ships to the loss of one Axis Class 6 the Allies suffered a decisive defeat in terms of material. Add in the point difference (2400) between the 168 hits below the waterline the Axis inflicted compared to the 120 hits below by the Allied ships and the Axis had scored a significant victory, 18,025 to 10,705, and overall had extended their lead to nearly 30,000 points.  </P>

<P>After the ships were recovered setup for Campaign began, but because the normal targets and barriers used for this event were unavailable a new target configuration was approved by the captains present – 40 clay pigeons used for BB gun target practice were glued to two 1” x 6” x 8 foot boards, 20 to a board, and each board was to be set free floating onto the pond at the start of Campaign. </P>

<P>Campaign lasts one hour and has two components. First, each side has 20 targets representing supplies for their warships that the opposing side tries to shoot down.  Once all of a fleet’s targets are shot down (chipped or completely shot away) that sides capital ships Class 4 and above are no longer able to “Call 5”, reload and re-enter the hour long battle. Smaller Class 3 and below ships are not affected, they can reenter at will as long as they aren’t sunk.</P>

<P>In the second component two harbors are set up either end of the shoreline, one for each fleet.  Each side has to launch at least one unarmed (no guns or pumps) convoy ship every 20 minutes of the hour long battle or be penalized.  The convoy ship cannot be defended and only one attacking ship can be within 10 feet of the convoy ship at a time. The convoy ship leaves its home port, gets 30 second free passage then has to last 5 minutes on the water before sailing into its forward base for (it is hoped) recovery.  A successful voyage earns the fleet points, the larger the ship the more points earned.  Warship damage is only scored if the warship is sunk, making it a tactical balancing act for the admirals to decide when/where to send combat ships (target shooting, hunt the convoy or engage enemy warships) and whether to conserve BBs to sink the defenseless convoy ships or turn them on enemy warships hoping for the big sink.</P>

<P>Captains were briefed on the rules, admirals discussed their strategies (or lack thereof) with their captains, the boards were set adrift and “Cam-Pain” began.  The Allies immediately launched the mighty USS SARATOGA captained by Capt. Rob Arena and the small LST (Capt. Nate Graham) upon the water while sending the MISSOURI and NORTH CAROLINA out to shoot Axis targets and the ARKANSAS, WYOMING and MARLBOROUGH out to hunt Axis convoy ships. In addition to SARA and the LST the Allies also had two other convoy ships that ran during Campaign, Capt. Graham’s small French-built steamer GOLO and the escort carrier USS GAMBIER BAY (aka Il Duce Wheelie Wagon – Adm. S. Andrews and Capt. M. Andrews taking turns commanding).</P>

<P>In response the AXIS launched the tramp streamer OKI MARU captained by Kapt. Ken Kelly and a T2 tanker captured by Kapt. Aidan Kelly (actually generously lent to the short-handed Axis Fleet by Tim Krakowski) along with BISMARCK, NASSAU and NAGATO followed by OSTFRIESLAND and LUTZOW.  OSTFRIESLAND hoped to use its relatively superior speed to attempt to coral the wily LST but found the LST was being expertly handled by Capt. Graham who used its tight turning ability to out-turn OSTFRIESLAND and sailed between other ships to shake her pursuers. The relatively diminutive NASSAU came alongside the huge SARATOGA and immediately began to put telling damage on the behemoth.  BISMARCK and NAGATO set sail for deeper waters to begin target practice against the Allied clay pigeons while the NORTH CAROLINA and DES MOINES attempted to do the same to the Axis targets. MISSOURI, the only ship present equipped with guns that could be depressed and elevated by remote control, tried setting the range of the dual sidemounts to “far” and running parallel to the board to rake the targets but the other ships prop wash kept moving the board, making for an ever changing target solution.</P>

<P>Sometime early in the battle Kapt. Kessler, always the problem solver, saw the way the boards moved and saw the Allies surrounding the still relatively close to shore Axis target board and had an inspiration – Move the Board!  Using the raw power of “the Beast” Kapt. Kessler quickly sailed over to the Axis target board, nosed into it amidships, and pushed the board the 50 feet or so to the far side of the pond, greatly complicating the Allies attempts to shoot the targets.  OSTFRIESLAND’s captain immediately saw the value of this tactic and nosed into the drifting Allied target board, pushed it CLOSER to shore and began taking down Allied targets. Other Axis ships came to fire on the now nearer targets while the NORTH CAROLINA tried to push the board away but was chased away.  It still took nearly 40 minutes before the final targets were shot down and both fleets left with either the ships they had on the water, ships that had been pulled and reloaded before their fleet’s final target was shot down and the few Class 3 or below ships each side possessed.  </P>

<P>While the targets garnered their fair share of attention the main events centered around the hunt for convoy ships.  As each ship entered (or re-entered – they could do so whether they completed their run or were sunk) the call went out “Allied (or Axis) convoy ship on the water!” and, at least early on, opposing warships would start toward the enemy’s base to intercept them.  The large SARATOGA launched three times but was sunk each time.  But the smaller, more maneuverable ships such as the OKI MARU, LST and GOLO had better luck as long as they could stay from under their opponents guns as even 1 hit below the waterline could sink them if hit early enough. An excerpt from Daisa Hunt’s battle report for NAGATO stated:</P>

<P>“By the time campaign rolled around I had correctly diagnosed the problem as a faulty speed controller (no steam supply to the turbine) but my brand new spares were not waterproofed yet, so I elected to go without starboard drive and maxed out the other drive.  It sufficed for campaign where I mostly just chase convoys with bow guns.  I waited until campaign was halfway done before launching, and went after the Saratoga and got a few rounds into it early on its third run, then went after ill duchess wheelie wagon and sank it, and spent my remaining bow gun ammo missing Nate Graham's LST.”</P>

<P>Kapt. K. Kelly made seven successful voyages and Kapt. A. Kelly five for the Axis earning 3000 points.  Allied Capt. Graham made six runs using the LST and GOLO earning 1450 points.  Additionally the DKM LUTZOW had run into trouble and was sunk increasing the Allied score to 2150, not enough to win the battle. So far the Allies had lost every battle of the week and their defeat assured.  The NORTH CAROLINA was detached Thursday night to send the news of inevitable defeat to the English royalty in Camelot.</P>

<P>The Risk Tournament resumed Thursday night with Allied Captain Brandon Graham “jobbering” (standing in) for Kapt. A. Kelly.  Capt. Graham immediately reinvigorated the demoralized forces in North America and vastly increased his position vis-a-vis Adm. Andrews while G.Adm. Tanner fought a brutal delaying action against Kapt. Camurati that left him in a weakened position.  This left Capt. Andrews free to Blitzkrieg across the board in one extremely impressive turn.  Collecting more cards and thus armies with every opponent’s defeat, first to fall was his father, Adm. Andrews quickly followed by the Axis Gross Admiral, Capt. Graham and, unable to staunch the rising tide against him, Kapt Camurati.  With this masterful stroke Matt Andrews justly earned the 2013 Risk Trophy.</P>


<P><H3><B>Day Five – Nailing the Lid on the Allied Coffin, or “Will Steve <I>Ever</I> Battle Ron?”</B></H3></P>


<P>Friday morning dawned and the Allied position, down by 30,000 points, was bleak. An Allied NATS victory was nothing short of impossible but perhaps they could avoid the “shut-out” and win the final battle. But the Allied misfortunes continued.  In addition to losing the NORTH CAROLINA and the CHARLOTTE still not completed they now lost their flagship, USS ARKANSAS, which had stripped out its customized main turbines with no replacements available.  The Allies would sail with only 5 ships to face the fully operational and manned Axis Fleet of 8 ships. Like the Light Brigade at Balaklava, the Allied Fleet sailed to face its opponents guns without regard of the odds.</P>

<P>First to fall was Capt. Andrew’s battered WYOMING (92-10-19), its pump not able to keep up as the ship settled and water began pouring in through the 92 above the waterline and 10 on the waterline hits.  Captains Arena and Krakowski bravely tried to help their comrade but were heavily damaged in the process.  The ARIZONA swung out of the battle line to the pump out but its damage of 117-8-25 was insurmountable and ARIZONA took an award winningly beautiful trip to the bottom.  MARLBOROUGH was in only slightly better shape and survived the sortie with the MISSOURI, ever pursued by the BISMARCK and NASSAU, and DES MOINES. </P>

<P>Looking for the sweep the Axis Fleet pursued, surrounded and dispatched MARLBOROUGH (94-15-37) and then turned its attention to the fast DES MOINES and large MISSOURI.  DES MOINES made slashing attacks through the Axis fleet and survived with only 9-3-6 in damage. MISSOURI found itself the center of Axis attention with BISMARCK keeping it on the run trying to force the big ship to suck more water into its perforated hull.  And then just as with BISMARCK early in the week, MISSOURI suddenly lost full steering and propulsion! Not quite dead in the water but unable to speed away as before and turning only with difficulty the small, slow Axis ships saddled up to the behemoth, so close as to cause the “Mighty Mo’s” shots to strike the decks of the low Axis dreadnoughts.  Round after round poured into MISSOURI’s which could only maneuver enough to keep the Axis ships from concentrating their shots below the waterline.  But even as the shots went home and the countdown to the end of MISSOURI’s “On 5” it was evident that Capt. Beahm’s damage control team had things well in hand.  A jeer went up by both sides when Capt. Beahm called out “MISSOURI off 5” and touched his battered ship.  And the cause of his restricted maneuverability – his rudders had “barn-doored” or turned sideways blocking the water flow from the propellers.  After having secured the award for most damage taken during the week in Battle #1 (145-6-69 + sunk = 6250 pts) he now had the distinction to also win the Alien Award for most damage taken and not sinking with a score of 6165 (209-31-66).  With this glorious high point for the Allies the battle and the war ended. </P>

<P>Outfought in every battle the Allied Fleet had for the 8th time running gone down in defeat to the mighty Axis Fleet, 91,920 to 49,655. Seventeen Allied ships had gone to the bottom of the pond (the ARKANSAS and MARBOROUGH accounting for 10 sinks alone) against the loss of four Axis ships. And even though the Axis brought fewer guns and thus fewer BBs to each battle they fired them more effectively.  The average hit percentage for the Axis Fleet for the week was 19.6% against the 8.3% hit rate the Allies achieved. </P>

<P>The new SMS NASSAU, after seeing the bottom of the pond twice, once again sailed in uncontested waters as the Allied Fleet limped home in defeat. The weary but proud Axis Fleet, flying victory flags, sailed home to ports mobbed by small craft and its sailors could not buy a drink in the Bierpalasts of Wilhelmshaven or geisha houses of Kure. </P>


<P><H3><B>EPILOGUE:</B></H3></P>

<P>Well, I’ll turn off the Axis propaganda machine now and put out a hearty “BRAVO ZULU” to the Site Host Rob Arena for organizing a great event and to Contest Director Carl Camurati who kept the trains running on time.    </P>

<P>The Awards Banquet Friday night was held at the Putnam Diner in Putnam, NY where everyone enjoyed some good food and relived highlights of the previous week. After voting for Best of Scale, Most Feared, Best Dressed and Brian Spychalski Awards the award presentation portion of the banquet began.  The results were:</P>

<P><B>Combat Awards</B></P>
<UL>
   <LI>Risk Trophy – Matt Andrews
   <LI>Alien Award (Most Damage w/o Sinking) – Jim Beahm, USS MISSOURI – 209-31-66 = 6165 points
   <LI>Swiss Cheese Award (Most Damage) – Jim Beahm, USS MISSOURI – 145-6-69 + sink = 6250 points
   <LI>Class 1 and 2 – None
   <LI>Class 3 – Ginger Andrews, USS DES MOINES
   <LI>Class 4 – Ken Kelly, SMS THURINGEN
   <LI>Class 5 – Aidan Kelly, SMS KONIG
   <LI>Class 6 – Chris Kessler, DKM BISMARCK
   <LI>One-on-One Trophy – Tom Tanner, SMS OSTFRIESLAND
   <LI>Lifeline Award – Ken Kelly, 7 runs in OKI MARU
   <LI>Von Fluegel – Chris Kessler, DKM BISMARCK     . . . but wait
</UL>

<P></UL>After Chris was announced as winner some folks (yes, me included ;-) asked how close the final scoring for the Von Fluegel was since we figured I had to be close with my two high scoring One-on-One victories.  The score keepers looked at each other with a “huh” look and said individual battle scores don’t count but the scoring had been close with only 100 points separating Chris and Ron Hunt.  Multiple captains replied individual battle scores do count.  So a quick check of the rules, a quick recalculation (spreadsheets are wonderful tools) and the dark horse coming from the back of the back to win the Von Fluegel Award by just 400 points is . . .Tom Tanner, SMS OSTFRIESLAND (at Class 4, smallest ship to win since the early 1980’s).  Yeah me!</P>
