					<td>The purpose of Campaign is to recreate scenarios reminiscent of those conditions which naval powers faced during the time period from 1905 to 1946 when they attempted to attack or defend strategic land objectives.  The safe passage of convoys and the control of surrounding waters in a war zone were often the crucial factors in the successful outcome of a campaign in war time.  Campaign tries to simulate those crucial times of difficult supply and sea control in a game which is easy to play and highly enjoyable for all involved.  The conditions being replicated during Campaign include the maintenance of water borne supply lines while at the same time trying to deny those lines to enemy forces.  The fleets battle for control of the sea lanes and receive points for successful convoy missions, and the protection of troops and supplies on land.</td>
